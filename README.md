# PicoBadUSB

A Bad USB, also known as a Rubber Ducky, is a type of device that looks like a regular USB thumb drive but behaves like a keyboard when plugged into a computer. It can automatically execute predefined keystrokes and commands, allowing it to perform various actions on the computer.

In the context of the "Windows Chaos" project you mentioned, the intention is to create a playful and harmless prank using a Bad USB. The project aims to create a chaotic window arrangement on a Windows computer when the Bad USB is connected. It involves opening and moving multiple application windows, creating a visually confusing and unpredictable desktop experience.

It's important to note that this project is designed purely for entertainment purposes and should be used responsibly, with the consent and knowledge of the person using the computer. The goal is to create a fun and lighthearted prank that brings amusement to the users involved. It's essential to respect others' privacy and ensure that the prank does not cause any harm or disruption.

Always exercise caution and adhere to legal and ethical guidelines when engaging in such activities. Communication and consent are key when playing pranks to ensure that everyone involved enjoys the experience.
